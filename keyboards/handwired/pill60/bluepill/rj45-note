# Note about RJ45 Straight Through and Cross Over

Pin - Pair - Color         Pairs
1   - 3    - Striped_Green Striped_Orange
2   - 6    - Solid_Green   Solid_Orange
3   - 1    - Striped_green striped_orange
4   - 4    - solid_blue    solid_blue
5   - 5    - striped_bue   striped_blue
6   - 2    - solid_green   solid_orange
7   - 7    - striped_brown striped_brown
8   - 8    - solid_brown   solid_brown

So, taking into account the swaps and commons, we can wire up RJ45 jacks
to serve as working with straight through and cross-over cables as:

# 6 conductors

## cross-over pair (1,3)

1 - RX/TX - PA9  - USART1
3 - TX/RX - PA10 - USART1

## cross-over pair (2,6)

2 - Left unused
6 - Left unused

## Straight Through pins

4:4 CAN BUS RX PB8 ??? I2C-SDA B9 B7
5:5 CAN BUS TX PB9 ??? I2C-SCL B8 B6
7:7 VCC
8:8 GND
